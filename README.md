Core values of Process GPT:

*   **Autonomous Business Process Automation**: Process GPT is designed to allow **AI agents to automatically execute defined business processes**, producing results without constant human instruction or manual execution of every step. This minimizes human intervention, embodying the ambient agent philosophy, and ensures that human involvement does not become a bottleneck, allowing agents to operate in highly automated processes.

*   **Flexible and Robust Collaboration via Multi-Agent Systems**: Process GPT configures **multiple AI agents to collaborate within a single workflow**, enabling them to professionally handle complex tasks and share intermediate results. This reliably automates high-complexity work that would be difficult for a single agent. Each agent leverages specialized domain knowledge and tools, and can automatically call upon other specialized agents to delegate tasks when necessary.

*   **Natural Language-Based Continuous Process Learning and Optimization**: Process GPT enables non-expert users to **define business processes using natural language**, which automatically generates initial process models. Moreover, it establishes an **automatic optimization cycle** by analyzing user feedback and system logs from agent performance, continuously improving processes and augmenting learning data for incorrect workflows to enhance future performance.

### For Detail:

* **Task Execution through a Multi-Agent System** (powered by CrewAI)
* **BPMN-based Hybrid Process Execution** (Deterministic / Stochastic modes)
* **Collaborative Work via the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**
* **Isolated Tool Invocation** through multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers (using Toolhive)
* **Integrations** with Browser-use, OpenAI Deep Research, Supabase, and N8n *(coming soon)*

## Design Principles

### Core Principle
**Users should be able to declare and modify processes, rules, system integration mechanisms, etc. in natural language, and the system should automatically improve with minimal feedback provided during use.**

All such changes must be **logged for tracking and recovery**, while users should simultaneously be able to directly control automation results and regulations through a **generalized UI** at any time.

---

### Principle 1. **Natural Language-Centric Definition and Training-Free Operation**
- All **process definitions, rules, system integrations, and business interfaces** should be writable in **natural language** without requiring programming knowledge or complex logical/mathematical thinking.
- Users should be able to design automation with **business objective or strategic-level descriptions** alone, without undergoing separate training processes.
- The system should be progressively refined and managed through **minimal feedback (approval, modification, rejection)** provided during actual use.

---

### Principle 2. **Human-in-the-Loop and Learning by Example**
- Automated agents must provide **human interfaces** that allow **people to substitute and perform tasks** at any time.
- Each task should provide **necessary context (related data, previous step outputs, similar cases)** in a clear and organized manner to facilitate human processing.
- Agents learn from **actual performance examples** where humans directly handle tasks, correcting and improving their execution knowledge. In other words, **human exemplars** become the agent's training data.

---

### Principle 3. **Automatic Compensation and Separation of Recovery Responsibility**
- When errors or failures occur in automated processes performed by agents, recovery should be automatically implemented through **compensating transactions (rollback)**.
- Operators should not need to track and correct agent details individually; **the system itself should take responsibility for failure recovery and processing**.
- This liberates users from system imperfections and ensures overall business continuity.

## Process-GPT Local Installation Guide (Kind)

This is a quick guide to running Process-GPT on a local Kubernetes/Kind cluster.

### üìã Prerequisites

* Docker
* kubectl
* kind

### üöÄ Installation & Execution

#### 1. Install Required Tools

```bash
# Install and run Docker Desktop
docker --version

# Install kubectl
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

# Install kind (Mac)
brew install kind

# Install kind (Windows)
curl.exe -Lo kind.exe https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.20.0/kind-windows-amd64
```

#### 2. Create the Cluster

```bash
# Mac
kind create cluster --name process-gpt

# Windows
.\kind.exe create cluster --name process-gpt
```

#### 3. Update Configuration Files (Required)

Edit `secrets.yaml` with your actual values:

```yaml
OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-your-actual-openai-key"
SUPABASE_KEY: "your-actual-supabase-anon-key"
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: "your-actual-supabase-service-role-key"
JWT_SECRET: "your-actual-jwt-secret"
DB_NAME: "your-db-name"
DB_USER: "your-db-user"
DB_PASSWORD: "your-db-password"
DB_HOST: "your-db-host"
